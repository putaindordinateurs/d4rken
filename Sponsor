Hello,
I hope this message finds you well, healthy, and most importantly ... Happy!
I have no idea if I'm putting this message in correct "area" or if you'll even get it. I apologize, the last "coding" I did involved Notepad, HTML (I think it was 2.0 maybe) a few basic javascript commands, and a bootleg version of Photoshop (the OG, I guess 1.0)
I just wanted to say, I dig what ya do!!! I think it's very Cool. Found ya through F-Droid or maybe Droidify and I love, Love, LOVE the "Maid" app ya made. I have some cool app ideas, but no idea how to even start building an apk. Honestly, mostly I still act like my phone is hooked to a wall, and just use a machine hooked to a screen, but I'm trying to be a bit less old school, I just am seriously opposed to a device with programs that I didn't install and can't uninstall I guess, sorta old old school AND Damn The Man kinda Dude. I'm very, VERY Cool with the "open source" type of attitude you exhibit though, I seriously dig that, but I digress ...
The actual reason I was writing was to ask if you'd do this: https://creators.brave.com/ That way I could afford to sponsor ya. I get that dough from Brave every month and only have 1 or 2 creators I dig enough to give it to, but I'd certainly add ya in there, cuz I like ya. It's only a couple bucks a month, and their virtual dough,  I think called BATs, is all over the place in value, but then again, it's all illusory anyway, but it does actually turn into a real spendable type currency, amd breads bread, right? Anyway, I don't think it's a hassle to sign up for, and Brave seems like a pretty dope group of folks, so I dig em, and it'll just be another way for ya make some cake on your creations and get ya to your monthly goal, and keep ya making dummies like me cool ways to get this junk off of my dang phone.  I did hear that Graphene actually might work bow without being a total drag, and I can't stand the G-word and Slavesung software crammed down my throat on my phone, but I'm afraid I wont be able to get cool stuff like you make from F-droid anymore. maybe I wont need it, I dunno, ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø  What I do know, is that I'd like to help ya out, and if ya do the Brave thingy, I can give ya some BATs, w/e the F they are ü§£
I hope ya get this, and I didn't put it somewhere I shouldn't have. Holla back if ya do the Brave thingy, and I'll hook ya up.
Thanks for your valuable time, I appreciate you!

Much love!!! ‚úå
